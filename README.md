## Description

This field plug-in can be used to determine how many times each link has been clicked. You can use this to make sure the enumerator has clicked on all needed links before moving on in the form.

## Features

* Automatically detect each link in the form by searching for the [`<a>` HTML tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a).
* Detect the number of times a link has been clicked in a field.
* Remembers number of times links clicked even when leaving field and coming back.
* All of the capabilities of the [select_one-select_multiple](https://github.com/surveycto/select_one-select_multiple/blob/master/README.md) field plug-in.

### Requirements

Android: Android 7 or up

iOS and web browsers: Because web browsers and iOS devices are kept more up-to-date with the latest features, nearly all web browsers and iOS devices should support the field plug-in, but test it on your collection device beforehand to be sure.

## Data format

The field value will be the selected choice.

The metadata will retrieve the URL of each link, and how many times it had been clicked. Each URL-number pair will be separated by a pipe `|`, and within each pair, the URL and number will be separated by a space. Here is an example:

    https://docs.surveycto.com/04-monitoring-and-management/01-the-basics/03a.using-data-explorer.html 1|https://docs.surveycto.com/04-monitoring-and-management/01-the-basics/04.reviewing-and-correcting.html 0

Here, the first URL has been clicked once, and the second URL has not been clicked at all.

You can use the plug-in-metadata(), item-at(), and selected() functions to retrieve the data you need. Check out our documenation on [using expressions](https://docs.surveycto.com/02-designing-forms/01-core-concepts/09.expressions.html) to learn about these functions. The sample form also demonstrates this for you.


## How to use

### Getting started

*To use this plug-in as is:*

1. Download the [sample form](https://github.com/surveycto/detect-clicked-link/raw/main/extras/sample-form/Detect%20clicked%20link%20sample%20form.xlsx) from this repo.
1. Download the [detect-clicked-link.fieldplugin.zip](https://github.com/surveycto/detect-clicked-link/raw/main/detect-clicked-link.fieldplugin.zip) file from this repo.
1. Upload the sample form to your server, with the field plug-in attached.

The field plug-in will automatically detect all links in the field using the `<a>` HTML tag, and it will track how many times each of those has been clicked.

### Parameters

This field plug-in has no parameters.
